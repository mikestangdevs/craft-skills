description: "Use the moment a real bug is found during any task — an audit, a review, a test wave, unrelated feature work — and the temptation appears to document it and move on. Defaults to fixing confirmed bugs in the current pass: a found bug is work surfaced, not work deferred. If a fix genuinely can't happen now (out of scope, needs a decision, blocked), the deferral must be explicit and accepted by the user — never a silent TODO buried in a report. Also fires on the half-kept feature: anything kept in the codebase gets finished properly or removed; there is no 'mostly works' tier. Use when an audit produced findings, when a report contains 'known issue', or when a bug was written down instead of fixed."

# Fix It Now

## The failure mode this fixes

An audit runs, finds six real defects, and produces a beautiful document listing them. The document gets filed. The defects stay. Three weeks later one of them detonates in front of a customer, and the worst part isn't the bug — it's that the system *knew*. "You found the bug and documented it but didn't fix it?" is the angriest sentence in code review, and it's earned.

Agents drift into bug-documentation mode because finding feels like finishing: the analysis was the hard part, the writeup is the artifact, surely fixing is "a separate task." But a confirmed bug with a known root cause is the *cheapest it will ever be to fix* — the context is loaded, the repro is fresh, the fix is usually small. Deferring it throws that context away and converts a ten-minute fix into a future debugging session.

The sibling failure: the half-kept feature. Something gets built to 80%, has known gaps, and stays in the codebase as a "mostly works" zombie — too present to ignore, too broken to trust.

## When to Use This Skill

- An audit, review, or test wave just produced confirmed findings
- You found a bug while working on something else and the instinct is "note it and stay on task"
- A report you're writing contains "known issue," "TODO," or "should be fixed later"
- A feature exists in a permanently-partial state — kept, but with gaps everyone routes around
- The user asks "did you fix it or just document it?"

**Don't use when:** the "bug" is unconfirmed (a hunch needs verification before it earns a fix), the fix requires a product decision that genuinely belongs to the user, or you're mid-critical-path and a context switch would endanger the primary task — in those cases, defer *explicitly* (see step 3), don't just skip the skill.

## Instructions

### 1. Confirm it's real, then treat the fix as part of the find

A finding's lifecycle is find → confirm → fix → verify, in one pass. The deliverable of an audit is not a list of bugs; it's a list of bugs *that no longer exist*, plus the residue that genuinely couldn't be fixed and why. Budget audits accordingly: an audit you only have time to half-fix is an audit you should scope smaller.

### 2. Fix in root-cause order, not discovery order

When a pass produces multiple findings, fix the ones that might be causing the others first. Re-test after each — some findings are shadows of the same defect, and the list often shrinks as you go.

### 3. If you must defer, defer loudly and get it accepted

A legitimate deferral (needs user decision, out of scope, blocked on external data) is a *negotiation*, not a footnote. State it directly: what the bug is, why it can't be fixed now, what it will cost to fix later, and what risk it carries until then — and get an explicit "okay, defer it" from the user. A TODO comment is not a deferral; it's a hiding place.

### 4. Apply the keep-it-or-kill-it rule to half-done features

Anything that stays in the codebase gets held to the codebase's standard. If a feature is kept, its known gaps are bugs — fix them now (this skill). If it's not worth finishing, remove it cleanly rather than leaving a zombie. "We'll finish it someday" is a decision to keep it broken; make that decision visible and let the user make it.

### 5. Verify the fix landed wired-in, not in isolation

A fix verified only in a unit harness can still be dead in the integrated path. Confirm the fix in the context where the bug actually bit — the full suite, the real pipeline, the rendered page.

## Output format

```
Findings from <pass>: <N confirmed>
Fixed now: <list — each with root cause and verification>
Deferred (explicitly accepted): <list — reason, cost-of-delay, user sign-off | none>
Keep-or-kill calls: <half-done features surfaced, with recommendation>
Net state: <what is now true that wasn't — not what is now documented>
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why it defeats the skill |
|---|---|
| Audit theater | a findings document as the end product, with zero diffs attached. |
| The buried TODO | deferral by comment, where no one with authority ever saw the decision. |
| "Tracked in backlog" | moving a live, confirmed, cheap-to-fix-now bug into a queue where context goes to die. |
| The zombie feature | permanently 80% done, exempted from quality standards by being perpetually "in progress." |
| Fixing without verifying wired-in | the patch is in the file; the bug is still in the product. |

## Mental Model

> A documented bug is a bug with better PR. The moment of discovery is the cheapest fix you will ever be offered — every deferral after that is buying the same fix at a markup.
